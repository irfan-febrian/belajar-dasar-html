      <strong>HyperText Markup Language or HTML</strong> is the standard
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language"
        >markup language</a
      >
      for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
      assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
      scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document.
