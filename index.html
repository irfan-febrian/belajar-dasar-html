    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>HyperText Markup Language or HTML</strong> is the standard
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language"
        >markup language</a
      >
      for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
      assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
      scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document.
    </p>
    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>
      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
      prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
      documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
      hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
      server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
      the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4]
      from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"
      and put an encyclopedia first.
